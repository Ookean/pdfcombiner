# Offline PDF Merger

This tool was created as I don't like the idea of publishing pdfs online to random webpages. Therefore, I created this
little tool that keeps it all on your computer and doesn't share any data or requires you to upload your personal
files.

The tool isn't polished and was quickly drafted with ChatGPT for now.

I plan to improve on the ui and create a deliverable so anyone can use the tool if wanted.
